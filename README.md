# Log Parsing and Basic Alert System
This is a basic program created using Python as the programming language. This system scans the log file for any suspicious activities or patterns such as 'unauthorized access', 'failed login attempts' and
'suspicious activities'. If such patterns are found then the system generates an alert by printing a message to the console.

# STEPS TO RUN THE CODE:
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your device.
2. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
3. Unzip the project and run it using an (IDE Visual Studio Code or Pycharm)
4. Run the program.

# Assumptions and limitations
1. It is a simple system that only reads the text based log file where each entry is on a new line.
2. It does not take real time logins into accounts and only analyzes static logs.
